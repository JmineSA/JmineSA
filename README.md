## 🛠 Projects:

- **Risk Assessment & Loan Approval Prediction** 💳: Built predictive models using a synthetic dataset of 20,000 records to assess financial risk and loan approval. Developed classification models (XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest) achieving up to 99.67% accuracy and a regression model for risk score prediction. Analyzed feature importance, model performance, and opportunities for improvement, such as addressing heteroscedasticity in regression.
- **Customer Churn Prediction** 📉: Developed a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn using a dataset of customer demographics, usage patterns, and support interactions. Implemented decision tree and logistic regression algorithms, achieving an 85% accuracy rate. The model was deployed as a web application, enabling the marketing team to proactively target at-risk customers with personalized retention offers. [Repo: [Link to Repo]] [Live Demo: [Link to Demo]] Data: customer demographic, usage, support data.
- **Video Success Prediction** 🎥: Analyzed video data (views, likes, comments) to predict success using regression models. Achieved 94% accuracy . The model explains 94% of the variation in video performance, which means it does a great job predicting which videos will perform well.
- **Web Scraping Automation** 🌍: Automated data collection from e-commerce websites using Python's BeautifulSoup and Scrapy. Implemented data cleaning and transformation pipelines, delivering structured datasets for market analysis. [Repo: [Link to Repo]] Data: E-commerce product data.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach:

I approach data science problems with a structured framework:
- **Understand the Problem:** First, I work with stakeholders to clearly define the business problem and set measurable goals.
- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** I use tools like Python (Pandas) and SQL to gather, clean, and prepare data for analysis.
- **Model Development:** I experiment with various machine learning algorithms, ensuring proper model evaluation and tuning for optimal performance.
- **Insight Communication:** I present insights through visualizations and reports using tools like Power BI, ensuring that non-technical stakeholders can understand the results.
